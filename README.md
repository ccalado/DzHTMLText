<details>
  <summary>Click here to view the entire changelog</summary>

- 11/14/2024 (Version 6.6)

   - Use GDI painting from Windows API when using VCL + Windows to draw rounded div
   - Fix access violation when DPI Scaling in VCL (early access to TForm.Monitor)

- 10/14/2024 (Version 6.5)

   - New Corner Radius ("radius") property for Div tag

- 03/26/2024 (Version 6.4)

   - Fix Delphi XE3 compiling (Design packages and FMX FillRect)

- 03/25/2024 (Version 6.3)

   - VCL font scaling review (Height is calculated by default screen PPI)

- 03/24/2024 (Version 6.2)

   - Better FMX design-time border (using the Delphi pattern).
   - Keep Canvas properties state in FMX (font changes and other Canvas properties were retained and could affect the painting of other controls on the form)

- 02/26/2024 (Version 6.1)

   - Opacity supporting in FMX environment.

- 02/23/2024 (Version 6.0)

   - New Design packages (build all packages and install only design packages). *The old packages were transformed into Runtime-only packages, so if you already had the component installed previously, you may receive an error message in Delphi saying that the package cannot be installed as it is Runtime-only. You can ignore this message, as the package will not be installed and will no longer be loaded at Designtime.*
   - New Syntax Errors list (right click on component in design mode and choose "Show Syntax Errors"). The component border will appear red when syntax errors.
   - Fixed word bounds size calculation for some platforms in FMX environment, like Android. The component was using MeasureCanvas to calculate bounds before canvas becomes available. Some platforms return wrong size (smaller) when using generic MeasureCanvas. Now we are using original Canvas, building tokens when Canvas becomes available. **This fix resolves the issue of characters cut in half at the end of the word.**
   - Fixed Tab margin on first line and Tab x Line Item x Paragraph Indent margin overload.
   - Reintroduced `<FLOAT>` tag (as obsolete tag).

- 02/20/2024 (Version 5.3)

   - Reorganization of component folders (Please completely delete the previous component folder). **WARNING! DCU output folder changed. Now output directory is `Lib\{Platform}\{Config}`. Please review your Library Paths.**
   - Auto-install now supports Delphi 12.

- 01/21/2024 (Version 5.2)

   - Fixed left margin after List tags (Unordered and Ordered lists).
   - Reintroduced `<T>` and `<TF>` tags.
   - New PlainText and GeneratePlainText properties (public) - removed HTMLToPlainText method.

- 01/12/2024 (Version 5.1)

   - Improved VCL x FMX x HTML color notation. Please read Color Notation topic.

- 01/05/2024 (Version 5.0)

     |-------------------------------------------------------------|

     In order to keep TDzHTMLText Text string property content of your projects, you'll need to manually change property on DFM file, before opening projects in Delphi.
     Open the DFM files (using a text editor) that contains TDzHTMLText objects and replace as in the example:

     ```delphi
     object DzHTMLText1: TDzHTMLText
	   //FROM:
       Text = 'Line 1'#13#10'Line 2'#13#10'Line 3'
	   //TO:
       Lines.Strings = (
         'Line 1'#13#10'Line 2'#13#10'Line 3')
     end
     ```

     If you want to keep old Text property, please download the older version here: [TDzHTMLText v2.0](https://github.com/digao-dalpiaz/DzHTMLText/releases/tag/v2.0)

- 07/27/2020 (Version 2.0)

   - Fixed multiple space strange behavior on line break.
   - Fixed when there was only one word on the line and the limit was less than it, which caused the word to skip the line.
   - New tag `<float>`, allowing you to create floating panels with content in free positions. :smile: :smile: :smile:
   - Implemented class functions to Escape and Unescape HTML text.
   - Included `&` (`&amp;`) unescape in internal reading of HTML text.
   - New tag `<spoiler>` and `<sdetail>`, creating closed/expanded div. :smile: :smile: :smile:
   - TDHLinkData removed and link events signature changed!!! **It is necessary to adjust the implemented methods for compatibility.** :warning:
   
      Removed:
	  - property SelectedLinkID
	  - function GetLinkData
	  - function GetSelected
	  
	  Please, use new `GetSelectedLink` property and `LinkRefs` list (*there is no longer the concept of link ID!*).

Supports Delphi XE3..Delphi 12

## Component Properties

> **TPixels** represents `Integer` in **VCL**, or `Single` in **FMX**.

`AutoBreak: Boolean` = When enabled, the component automatically converts Line Break sequence into a new line. If you don't want the line break in a specific sequence, you can use the `<NBR>` tag after Line Break sequence.

`AutoHeight: Boolean` = Auto set height of control when Text property changed

`AutoWidth: Boolean` = Auto set width of control when Text property changed.
If you are using AutoWidth, the text never wraps to a new line unless a line break is specified at text or there is a value specified in MaxWidth property.

`AutoOpenLink: Boolean` = Open links automatically on click over, without set event OnLinkClick.

`Borders: TDHBorders` = Defines `Left`, `Top`, `Right` and `Bottom` sub-properties, specifying the text area margins.

`Color: TColor` = Background color of control. In FMX environment, `Null` represents transparent background.

`CustomStyles: TDHHeaderStyles` = Collection of header styles to use with tag `<H:ident>`, where `ident` is Ident property of a header style in collection list.

`Font: TFont` = Determines the base font. When no tag is specified on text, this base font is used.

`Images: TCustomImageList` = When using `<img>` tag, you should set this property to specify the ImageList where the images are stored. In FMX environment, this property is only available using Delphi XE8 or higher.

`LineCount: Integer` = Returns the total lines of text, according to the bounds of control. This property is read-only.

`Lines: TStrings` = The text you want to show at label control. You can use `<BR>` tag to break lines. The default Line Break sequence breaks lines either when AutoBreak property is enabled.

`LineSpacing: TPixels` = Specify the default line spacing in overall text. You can use `<LS>` tag to determine line spacing at specific lines.

`LineHorzAlign: TDHHorzAlign (haLeft, haCenter, haRight)` = Allows you to specify the horizontal alignment of each element in the line. Default is `haLeft`.

`LineVertAlign: TDHVertAlign (vaTop, vaCenter, vaBottom)` = Allows you to specify the vertical alignment of each element in the line. This property only take effects when the elements have different heights at same line. Default is `vaTop`.

`ListLevelPadding: TPixels` = Determines the width of each list level in pixels, when using HTML list tags.

`MaxWidth: TPixels` = Specify the maximum width of text, when using AutoWidth property.

`Offset: TDHOffset` = Sets Top and Bottom offset (spacing in Pixels) for each line. When using `<offset>` tag, it will replace this setting, according to the specified attribute (top and/or bottom).

`OverallHorzAlign: TDHHorzAlign (haLeft, haCenter, haRight)` = Determines overall text horizontal alignment. This property only take effects if `AutoWidth` is false.

`OverallVertAlign: TDHVertAlign (vaTop, vaCenter, vaBottom)` = Determines overall text vertical alignment. This property only take effects if `AutoHeight` is false.

`ParagraphCount: Integer` = Returns the total paragraphs of text. This property is read-only.

`ParagraphIndent: TPixels` = Default left margin of a new paragraph.

`ParagraphSpacing: TPixels` = Specify the default paragraph spacing in overall text. The paragraph spacing is added to original line spacing. You can use `<LS>` tag to determine paragraph spacing at specific lines.

`RightToLeftText: Boolean` = Enables Right-to-left text notation.

`StyleLinkNormal: TDHStyleLinkProp` = Properties to format a link when is not selected by mouse.

`StyleLinkHover: TDHStyleLinkProp` = Properties to format a link when is selected by mouse.

`SyntaxErrors: TDHSyntaxErrorList` (public) = List of syntax errors. Right click on component and choose "Show Syntax Errors" at design time to show syntax errors. **When any syntax error, at design time the border of the component will be draw with red color.**

`Text: string` (public) = This property is a shortcut to `Lines` property. At run-time, you can read and write this property directly, but the component will store the text at `Lines` property.

`TextHeight: TPixels` = Returns the total text height. This property is read-only.

`TextWidth: TPixels` = Returns the total text width. This property is read-only.

`Transparent: Boolean` (only in VCL) = Enables component transparency. **Warning: When using with links, it will cause flickering when redrawing component.**

## Events

```delphi
procedure OnLinkEnter(Sender: TObject; Link: TDHBaseLink);
```
This event is fired when the mouse enters a link area

```delphi
procedure OnLinkLeave(Sender: TObject; Link: TDHBaseLink);
```
This event is fired when the mouse leaves a link area

```delphi
procedure OnLinkClick(Sender: TObject; Link: TDHBaseLink; var Handled: Boolean);
```
This event is fired when a link is left-clicked by the mouse. You can use Handled var to by-pass the AutoOpenLink property (the handled value is False at method start).

```delphi
procedure OnLinkRightClick(Sender: TObject; Link: TDHBaseLink; var Handled: Boolean);
```
This event is fired when a link is right-clicked by the mouse. You can use Handled var to by-pass the AutoOpenLink property (the handled value is False at method start).

```delphi
procedure OnRetrieveImgRes(Sender: TObject; const ResourceName: string; Picture: TAnyPicture; var Handled: Boolean);
```
If you are using `<imgres>` tag, this event will fire on every image tag, allowing you to manually load a image from anywhere, in any image format, assigning it to Picture object. Be sure to set `Handled := True` when you manually load an image.
*Not using this event causes the component to automatically load the image from application resources by name, and must be in PNG format when using VCL environment. In FMX environment you can use any image format supported by Delphi.*

Example:

```delphi
procedure TForm1.DzHTMLText1RetrieveImgRes(Sender: TObject; const ResourceName: string;
  Picture: TAnyPicture; var Handled: Boolean);
var JPG: TJpegImage;
begin
  if ResourceName='TEST' then
  begin
    JPG := TJpegImage.Create;
    try
      JPG.LoadFromFile('C:\Test.jpg');
      Picture.Assign(JPG);
    finally
      JPG.Free;
    end;

    Handled := True; 
  end;
end;
```

## Procedures/Functions

```delphi
function IsLinkHover: Boolean;
```
This function returns true when the mouse is over a link

```delphi
function SelectedLink: TDHBaseLink;
```
This function returns the object of the selected link. A link is selected when the mouse is over it. If there is no link selected, this property is `nil`.

```delphi
procedure Rebuild;
```
This method rebuilds all internal text elements to get component ready to paint. Call this method if you want to get some calculated property, like TextWidth and TextHeight. Otherwise, you don't need to call this procedure directly.

```delphi
procedure BeginUpdate;
```
Increments internal update semaphore, so while reference counting is bigger than zero, the component will not repaint automatically when the properties are changed, like changing Text or Font property.

```delphi
procedure EndUpdate(ForceRepaint: Boolean = True);
```
Decrements internal update semaphore, so when reference counting is zero, if `ForceRepaint` parameter is True, then the component will repaint the HTML Text.

*BeginUpdate/EndUpdate example:*
```delphi
DzHTMLText1.BeginUpdate;
try
  DzHTMLText1.Text := 'Text <b>test</b> 1234';
  DzHTMLText1.Font.Color := clRed;
  DzHTMLText1.Font.Size := 20;
finally
  DzHTMLText1.EndUpdate;
end;
```

> Do not use `Lines.BeginUpdate/Lines.EndUpdate`. These methods are not controlled by the component.

## Link Reference Tag

There are two ways to use link tag:

1. Declaring internal link and the text do display:

   `<a:www.google.com>Open Google Search</a>`

   *This will display: [Open Google Search](http://www.google.com)*

2. Just using the display text:

   `<a>www.google.com</a>`

   *This will display: www.google.com*

> You can use any text as internal link code. Then you can handle this code at *link events*, reading `Link` parameter.

> Do not use link tags (`<a>`, `<spoiler>`, `<sdetail>`) inside a `<a>` tag!

## Spoiler Tag

This tag allows you to create a link and a detail div, where the detail is automatically expanded or collapsed when the mouse clicks on the link.

To create the spoiler link: `<spoiler:name>This is the spoiler link text</spoiler>`

To create the detail div: `<sdetail:name>This is the detail div that will be expanded when the spoiler link is clicked.</sdetail>`

The spoiler name is **case insensitive**.

> You can handle spoiler link at *link events*. It's possible to bypass expand/collapse behavior using `Handled` property.

> You can use another spoilers inside a spoiler detail div.

> It's allowed to create multiple links pointing to a single detail div, and it's allowed to create a single link pointing to multiple detail divs.

> Do not use link tags (`<a>`, `<spoiler>`, `<sdetail>`) inside a `<spoiler>` tag!

## Link object

**TDHBaseLink has two child classes possible:**
- TDHLinkRef: It's a link created by `<a>` tag.
- TDHSpoiler: It's a spoiler created by `<spoiler>` tag.

**Properties:**

- `Kind: TDHLinkKind` = The link kind (lkLinkRef or lkSpoiler).

- `LinkRef: TDHLinkRef` = References the TDHLinkRef object when link kind is a `<a>` tag.

   **TDHLinkRef object:**
   - `Target: string` = The link target specified at `<a:target>` tag.
   - `Text: TStringBuilder` = The link display text specified at `<a:target>Display Text</a>` inner text.   

- `Spoiler: TDHSpoiler` = References the TDHSpoiler object when link kind is a `<spoiler>` tag.

   **TDHSpoiler object:**
   - `Name: string` = The spoiler name.
   - `Expanded: Boolean` = If the spoiler details is expanded.

**Link events**

You can retrieve this object using OnLinkClick / OnLinkRightClick / OnLinkEnter / OnLinkLeave events. Also you can call `GetSelectedLink` or reading `LinkRefs` and `Spoilers` lists.

## Image Tag

You can use the tags:

- `<IMG:index>` to show an image of a TImageList component. Just assign the Images property to the ImageList. Then use the `index` parameter to indicate the index of the image in the ImageList component. *In FMX environment, this is only available using Delphi XE8 or higher.*

- `<IMGRES:name>` to show an image of a resource. Include an image into application resources and then use the `name` parameter to indicate the name of the resource. In VCL environment, the image must be in PNG format. In FMX environment, all Delphi supported images are allowed. **Important: the image will be displayed only at runtime.**

Example:

![App Resources Dialog](images/app_resources_dialog.png)

In this example, the image tag should be `<imgres:test>`

## Div Tag

![Div Example](images/div.png)

Syntax of the image above:

```html
<div:
margin=40,
thick=5,
pad=20,
lncolor=clGray,
color=clWhite,
outcolor=clLime
><bc:clYellow>Some text inside a div</bc></div>
```

The component is based in Div areas. This mean the main area of component is a Div, and you can insert sub divs, and another divs inside divs, and so on. The div tag allows you to work with alignment, colors, borders, margin, and you can even make a table using multiple divs.

The div tag may be floating, using specific X and Y position, or docked to the current text, when not specifying any position.

Please, refer to all possible parameters in [Available tags](#available-tags).

## Tab Tag

There are two **tab** tags you can use:

- `<t:nnn>` = Allow you to positioning text exactly on "nnn" position in pixels starting on the left border of component. If the text wraps to a new line, it will be return aligned at left border of component.
- `<tf:nnn>` = The same as above, but if the text wraps to a new line, it will be aligned in the same position as the first line which the tab started. This tag will produce a better visual text alignment.

## Literal tag character

If you want to display literal special characters in the text, just type the HTML code:

- `&amp;` = `&`
- `&lt;` = `<`
- `&gt;` = `>`

There are two class functions to deal with HTML characters:

```delphi
class function EscapeTextToHTML(const aText: string): string;
class function UnescapeHTMLToText(const aHTML: string): string;
```

> As this component is not a complete HTML language debugger, there is no need to escape the other special characters. Therefore, for characters such as accentuation, for example, or other signs, you must use them normally.

## Chinese/Japanese/Korean line break

If you have component width smaller than your text, then it will break to a new line according to some specific chars.
These chars are: ` ` (space), `\` and `/`. The bars are considered as word break because if you type some path, for example, then should be a way to split this path into a new line if it was too big.

When you type Chinese, Japanese or Korean characters, this behavior is quite different. In this case, the component will break lines considering any char as a complete word.

## Auto Scaling

### VCL (Delphi and Lazarus)

All measurements will be calculated based on the Design DPI (always 96 pixels per inch), and applied to the current Monitor DPI. Example: if you specified a tab width as 60 pixels, at 96 DPI, when displaying the text on a 120 DPI monitor, the tab width will be larger (75 pixels).

For automatic scaling by DPI to work correctly, it is necessary to use Windows 8.1 or higher, and Delphi 10 or higher, or Lazarus.
If using Delphi previous version, the scaling will be disabled.
If using Windows previous version, the scaling will be based on the default monitor DPI, and not on application current monitor.

### FMX

In FMX environment, auto scaling is controled by Fire Monkey framework, automatically scaling the entire form layout and its components.

## Color Notation

When using tags like `<fc:color>` or `<bc:color>`, you can specify these color notation options:

- VCL Style: `$00BBGGRR`, where BB=Blue Color, GG=Green Color, RR=Red Color.
- VCL Literal: `clColor` -> example: clBlack, or clWindowText.
- FMX Style: `#AARRGGBB`, where AA=Alpha Chanel, RR=Red, GG=Green, BB=Blue (when using in VCL, alpha channel only supports `FF` value).
- FMX Literal: `Color` -> example: Black (FMX TAlphaColor does not support system colors).
- HTML Style: `#RRGGBB`, where RR=Red, GG=Green, BB=Blue (when using in FMX, alpha channel will be set to `FF` - solid).

You can specify VCL notation when using FMX component, or even using FMX notation when using VCL component. The same for HTML notation.
